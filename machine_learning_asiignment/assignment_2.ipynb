    "Ans - > machine learning is the part of AI.here we fed the use data to machine after that machine(using cpu, gpu,RAM) find the some kind of pattern on fed data using the some kind of mathematical algorithm after find the pattern it will store the pattern in the some file(.txt,.pickle,.sav,.h5) , next time it will automatically predict the without being explicitely programmed.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - > Penalty is imposed in training phase for the model when it predict the wrong , in other words it sets the algorithm one step back. A reward is gained for every correct prediction or classification, which means the algorithm goes one step ahead towards making itself more effective. Hundreds of such iterations are performed over and over for the model to become ready."
