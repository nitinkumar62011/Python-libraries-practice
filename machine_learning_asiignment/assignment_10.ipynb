    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "Bayesian probability is a conditional probability which can be defined as: The probability of A given B when B already happend or P(A|B) is equal to the Probability of B given A or P(B|A) multiplied by Probability of A or P(A), whole divided by Probability of B or P(B). or\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "Probability of a union of two events can be defined as: The probability of a union of two events A and B (A U B) is equal to the sum of probabilities of A and B, subtracting the probability of intersection of two events A and B.\n",

    "3. What is joint probability? What is its formula?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "ans ->\n",
    "Joint probability or the multiplicative rule of probability is the probability of two events occuring mutualy exclusive given that the events are independent and they do not effect to ecah other.\n",

    "\n",
    "P(X=x) = p^x(1 - p)^(1-x) where p is the probability of success and 1-p is probability of failure where a random variable X can take only two values 0 and 1. x=1 would mean probability of success gets activated while x=0 would mean probability of failure gets activated.\n",
