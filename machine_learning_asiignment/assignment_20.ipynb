    "1. What is the underlying concept of Support Vector Machines?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - > Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well. Support Vectors are simply the co-ordinates of individual observation. The SVM classifier is a frontier which best segregates the two classes (hyper-plane/ line).\n",

    "2. What is the concept of a support vector?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "Support vectors are data points that are closer to the hyperplane or lies on the margin line and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. Using these support vectors, we maximize the margin of the classifier. Deleting the support vectors will change the position of the hyperplane. These are the points that help us build our SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When using SVMs, why is it necessary to scale the inputs?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "Because Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization occurs by minimizing the decision vector w, the optimal hyperplane is influenced by the scale of the input features and it’s therefore recommended that data be standardized (mean 0, var 1) prior to SVM model training. Advantage of scaling is to avoid attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. Another advantage is to avoid numerical difficulties during the kernel calculation.\n",

    "4. When an SVM classifier classifies a case, can it output a confidence score? What about a percentage chance?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "An SVM classifier can give the distance between the test instance and the decision boundary as output, so we can use that as a confidence score, but we cannot use this score to directly converted it into class probabilities. But if you set probability=True when building a model of SVM in Scikit-Learn, then after training it will calibrate the probabilities using Logistic Regression on the SVM’s scores. By using this techniques, we can add the predict_proba() and predict_log_proba() methods to the SVM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Should you train a model on a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features using the primal or dual form of the SVM problem?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "This question applies only to linear SVMs since kernelized can only use the dual form. The computational complexity of the primal form of the SVM problem is proportional to the number of training instances m, while the computational complexity of the dual form is proportional to a number between m2 and m3. So if there are millions of instances, you should definitely use the primal form, because the dual form will be much too slow. The dual problem is faster to solve than the primal when the number of training instances is smaller than the number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let's say you've used an RBF kernel to train an SVM classifier, but it appears to underfit the training collection. Is it better to raise or lower (gamma)? What about the letter C?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "There might be too much regularization. To decrease it, you need to increase gamma or C (or both). Increasing gamma makes the bell-shape curve narrower, and as a result each instance's range of influence is smaller: the decision boundary ends up being more irregular, wiggling around individual instances. Conversely, a small gamma value makes the bell-shaped curve wider, so instances have a larger range of influence, and the decision boundary ends up smoother. A smaller C value leads to a wider street but more margin violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. To solve the soft margin linear SVM classifier problem with an off-the-shelf QP solver, how should the QP parameters (H, f, A, and b) be set?\n",
    " \n",
    "8. On a linearly separable dataset, train a LinearSVC. Then, using the same dataset, train an SVC and an SGDClassifier. See if you can get them to make a model that is similar to yours.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "ans - >\n",
    " it depends on the dataset and of course a lot of other factors add weight but today in this small post I’ll demonstrate how to use LinearSVC , SVC classifier and SGD classifier via Python code and also compare results for the same dataset. Since classifiers are very sensitive to outliers we need to scale them but before we need to pick the right dataset, for simpler results I’ll showcase the benchmark dataset for all classifiers — the Iris dataset."
