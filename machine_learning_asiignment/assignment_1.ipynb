    "  <h2>1. recomandation system</h2> - It is the most famous application in business field and entertainment industry  today so many companies are targeting the most valuable customers by giving the directed product based on the user choice . Example Youtube , netflix,Amazon \n",
    "  <p></p>\n",
    "  <h2>2 . Autonomus vehicle </h2>- this industry is also getting the more attention beacause of the deep learning . we are automating the vehicle to some extent and protecting the life people . lets suppose we can take example most of dangerous conditions we are not able to take a action so in this case car automatically will take some appropriate actions like stooping the car before hitting the any object . recently we have seen the accident of the famous indian crickter Rishabh pant car collision. if his car would had some kind of automatically triggered breaking system in the car , it would have been automatically triggered and Rishabh pant did not get any kind of accidental damage.\n",
