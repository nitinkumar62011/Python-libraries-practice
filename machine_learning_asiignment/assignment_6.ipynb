    "Ans - >\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Model is an algorithmic function that has been trained on some data. This model can be used for solving prediction and clustering related problems by using input in the form of independent variables the model used to establish patterns and output results using the same patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to build models and can be filtered down by gauging the advantages and disadvantages against our problem statement. But to put in the most general terms, if the key steps in a machine learning model building are done with utmost care, the model would be the best. This includes good data pre-processing practices, carefully choosing an algorithm over others and more."

    "In the sense of machine learning 'No free lunch' means we can not depend on the single model and we have also some kind of constraint on the optimization of the all algorithm in the simmilar way.In the machine learning single model does not perform well so according to the theorem we should choose the multiple model based on the our algorithm knowledge."

    "6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part does it play?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "Ensemble methods or ensemble machine learning models are models where more than one models are being used spontaneously to produce better results than individually trained models. Ensemble models are of 4 types\n",
    "Bagging which is also called Bootstrap aggregation. Multiple base learners learn on subsets of data. A majority vote based on the results of the individual base learners is then used to output the final result. Example: Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is mainly used to reduce bias in model. Multiple base learners are trained in a sequence in which each learner covers up the weakness of the previous learner to ultimately produce a powerful model. Example: Adaptive Boosting or Adaboost\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacking is an ensemble model that combines multiple base learner models constructed parallel to each other and independent. All the models produce predictions that are used creating a meta classifier which is trained on the predictions made by base models. The resultant prediction is then taken as the final prediction. Space and Time complexity issue is huge for stacking models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cascading models are built when the cost of making a mistake in prediction is high. A threshold is chosen for multiple base learners. If one base learner is sure about its prediction(Probability>0.99), then the solution of this learner is taken as the final solution. Else, the problem is sent to a more sophisticated, complex model that does the same as the previous model. The problem either gets solved with probability>0.99 or it keeps getting transfered to a more complicated model that is bound to solve it.\n",

    "8. Describe how to evaluate a linear regression model.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Ans - >\n",
    "Evaluation of a linear regression model can be done using R-square. R square is calculated as the sum of squared errors in predictions made, divided by summation of all sum of squares. R square measures how much of the change in target variable can be explained by the linear regressor. Its value ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 means poor performance and 1 means good.\n",

    "Ans - >\n",
    "i. Descriptive vs. predictive models\n",
    "Descriptive models are built to identify trends and underlying patterns. Predictive models are built to predict a dependent variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of descriptive models are built using unsupervised machine learning. Most of predictive models are built using classification and regression models.\n",

    "\n",
    "ii. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model\n",
    "Underfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too simple, or when the machine learning model is way too simple to produce good results. Overfitting is a situation arising when the hypothesis is way too complex, or when the machine learning model is way too complex to produce good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting causes a model to produce poor results due to heavily simplified algorithm reacting lightly to changes in the unseen data for independent variables from the training data . Overfitting makes a model produce poor results due to slightest variations in the unseen data for independent variables from the training data\n",

    "iii. Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation\n",
    "Boostrap sampling is a method of sampling in which the repeated sampling is done with replacement using a data D in random draws over which machine learning models are trained for better performance. Cross validation is a method used to check the efficacy of the machine learning model on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "End goal of bootstrapping is to reduce overfitting and increase performance. End goal of cross validation is only to produce test scores to check efficacy of model\n",

    "i. LOOCV\n",
    "LOOCV or Leave One Out Cross Validation is a form of K-fold cross validation where only one observation is left out for validation purpose while the rest of the data is used for model training each iteration. It is computationally taxing and should only be used for data with low dimensionality.\n",

    "ii. F-measurement\n",
    "Harmonic mean of Precision score and recall score is called F-measurement or F-score. It is formulated as 2 * (pr * re)/pr +re where pr is precision score and re is recall score.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. The width of the silhouette\n",
    "Estimate of average inter cluster distance to give efficacy/performance of cluster algorithms is called width of the silhouette. It can also be defined as how identical/similar a data point 'x' is to the data points inside the cluster to which x is assigned. Its value ranges from -1 to 1 where 1 means good and -1 means bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Receiver operating characteristic curve\n",
    "Curve plotted between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate is Receiver Operating Characteristics curve and is used to find the area under the curve for ROC-AUC score for binary classification evaluation. True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate are calculated for different thresholds values where thresholds take values starting from the highest probability scores assigned to data points and goes up to the lowest probability score. The curve is impacted by presence of outliers, and simple models. Extensions can be made to this curve to suit multiclass classification evaluation requirements."
