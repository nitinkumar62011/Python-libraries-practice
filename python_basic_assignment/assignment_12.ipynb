Distributed architecture to report faulty drones using anonymous ephemeral identiﬁers.\\nIn contrast to the approach depicted in Figure 1, drones exchange lists of ephemeral identities\\nand locally update their status without the necessity of central intermediary services. The main\\ndifferences with respect to the centralized version are in Steps 2 and 3, which are conducted now in a\\nmachine-to-machine mode.\\nIn contrast to the approach illustrated in Figure 1, drones can now request and obtain\\nlists of ephemeral identities and locally check whether or not their neighbors are potentially\\nfaulty. Remote cloud and edge services can be used as a redundant resource to store,\\nforward, and broadcast lists of potentially defective drones identiﬁed by their ephemeral\\nidentities. In some mission-speciﬁc applications, a delegation of distributed processing\\nto edge nodes and cloud services leads to assumptions and issues, which are not always\\npossible to solve—for example, in situations where the deployment of dedicated infrastruc-\\nture and centralization is not possible. At the same time, the use of distributed computing\\nwith collaborative drones may lead to more complex scenarios when managing, e.g., fault\\ndiagnosis, which is a promising future research ﬁeld in collaborative drone scenarios with\\nwell-established foundations from cooperative multi-agent systems [ 22,23]. We consider\\nthat further work remains to address such additional scenarios.\\n3. Countering Drone Threats\\nDrones can be used in illicit activities. Several cases have been documented lately.\\nIn Saudi Arabia, terrorists used drones to attack oil pumping stations [ 24]. A Turkish\\ncompany has developed an autonomous suicide drone [ 25]. Drones ﬂying close to airports,\\nbusiness centers, and elsewhere in densely populated areas pose a direct danger to critical\\ninfrastructure and humans. There are numerous incidents involving rogue drones violating\\nairspace. Drones have also been used to smuggle drugs into the walls of jails [ 10]. These\\nincidents call for technology to protect infrastructures and populations from harmful\\nactivities perpetrated leveraging drones.\\n3.1. Problem Description\\nThe problem is threefold:\\n1. Spotting and Following. When do drones enter a given airspace? Are they friends or\\nadversaries? What tasks are drones specially ﬁtted for? Are they armed? Loaded?\\nWhat is their kind? How many rotors do they have? Are they small? Micro? Are they\\nequipped with infrared cameras? Are drones autonomous or under the command and\\ncontrol of a human pilot? What are the whereabouts of spotted drones?\\n2. Intention determination. What is the drones’ mission? Are they looking around infras-\\ntructures? Searching? Are they preparing for a strike? What is their target? Are they'"
